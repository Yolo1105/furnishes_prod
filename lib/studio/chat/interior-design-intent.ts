/**
 * Interior Design intent classifier.
 *
 * The user explicitly wanted Interior Design mode to BOTH chat AND
 * take action. The previous behavior routed every Interior Design
 * message through /api/chat (text-only) — even when the user said
 * "give me a sofa," they got a chatty advisory response instead of
 * an actual generated piece.
 *
 * v0.40.16 redesign: my first version (v0.40.15) was too restrictive.
 * It defaulted to "chat" and only generated when the user hit a
 * specific verb+noun pattern. Real users say things like "yes
 * generate everything" or "do the layout" or just "regenerate" —
 * none of which matched the v0.40.15 rules. The user reported the
 * AI "just keeps talking" instead of generating.
 *
 * The new approach inverts the default. In Interior Design mode the
 * user is HERE TO DESIGN — they want generation. Chat is the
 * exception, reserved for clear question phrasings:
 *
 *   • Starts with what / how / why / when / where / which / who
 *   • Starts with "should I" / "could you tell me" / "do you think"
 *   • Ends with a question mark AND has no generation verb
 *
 * Everything else is treated as a generation request, with a
 * sub-decision between room vs furniture based on what nouns
 * appear in the message:
 *
 *   • If a room noun is present → generate-room
 *   • If only furniture nouns are present → generate-furniture
 *   • If neither → generate-room (the studio is built around rooms;
 *     when the user is being vague in Interior Design mode they
 *     probably want a layout, not a single piece)
 *
 * The classifier is rule-based — no extra Claude call per turn —
 * and the rules above cover the common cases the user actually
 * sends. Edge cases drift toward generation, which is the whole
 * point of Interior Design mode.
