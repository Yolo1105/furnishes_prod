/**
 * Wall extraction ported from the zip's `viewer/Apartment.tsx`. Walks
 * every mesh whose name starts with `1_` or `3_` (apartment structure
 * + living-room walls), reads its triangle geometry in world space,
 * and slices each triangle by a horizontal plane at chest height
 * (`SLICE_Y = 1.2`). The intersection of each triangle with that
 * plane is a line segment — over the whole structure mesh, those
 * segments form the floor plan's wall outline.
 *
 * The crucial property: this is done in **world space** by reading
 * each vertex through `mesh.matrixWorld`. Whatever transforms the
 * Sketchfab/.fbx wrapper layers add, plus our `normalizeScene`
 * scale + translate, all get baked into the resulting wall
 * coordinates. So the output frame matches the frame any other
 * mesh-derived data uses (e.g. `Box3.expandByObject` over a
 * furniture mesh) — walls and furniture co-locate without further
 * coordinate gymnastics.
 *
 * After walls are extracted, `detectOpenings` scans pairs of wall
 * endpoints for gaps between 0.55 and 1.5 metres (typical door
 * width) — those gaps are recorded as `Opening` records of kind
 * `"door"` so the floor plan can draw a door arc through each.
