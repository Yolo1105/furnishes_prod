/**
 * Singapore HDB profile — Phase 1 of the Singapore market support.
 *
 * Source of truth: the 2025–2026 HDB reference document the user
 * provided. Captures the physical dimensions and design conventions
 * of HDB flats built after year 2000 (post-2000 builds — pre-2000
 * HDB flats are 20–30% larger, NOT covered here for v1).
 *
 * Scope of this file:
 *   - Three mainstream flat types: 3-room, 4-room, 5-room (these
 *     cover ~89.4% of HDB stock; all others combined = 10.6%).
 *   - For each flat type: per-room dimensions for the four design-
 *     relevant zones (master bedroom, common bedroom, living/dining,
 *     kitchen). Bathrooms and service yards are universal and
 *     captured at the flat level.
 *   - Universal HDB conventions that apply across all three types:
 *     enclosed kitchen, mandatory household shelter, ceiling height
 *     2.6–2.8m, all bedrooms have external windows, bedrooms are
 *     near-square (1.0:1 to 1.2:1 aspect ratio).
 *
 * Out of scope for v1:
 *   - 1-room rental, 2-room Flexi (singles/elderly only — different
 *     target audience from interior-design app users).
 *   - Executive Apartment, Executive Maisonette, 3Gen, Jumbo, DBSS
 *     (rare — combined < 10% of stock).
 *   - Pre-2000 HDB sizing (the doc says 20–30% larger; can add a
 *     sub-toggle later when a user asks for it).
 *   - Standard/Plus/Prime classification (policy not physical —
 *     doesn't change room dimensions, only resale rules).
 *
 * Coordinate convention: the studio uses metres throughout. Each
 * room's width/depth here become roomMeta.width_m / depth_m when
 * the orchestrator builds the AssembledScene.

/** v0.40.41 — heuristic detector that scans a prompt for HDB intent
 *  and returns a suggested profile, or null when no Singapore-
 *  specific signal is present.
 *
 *  Design philosophy: REQUIRE a Singapore-specific anchor before
 *  suggesting anything. "design my master bedroom" alone must NOT
 *  trigger a suggestion — Western users design master bedrooms too.
 *  We need at least one of:
 *    - the literal word "HDB" or "BTO" or "Singapore"
 *    - an explicit HDB-style flat-type token like "3-room", "4-room",
 *      or "5-room" (these phrases are vanishingly rare in non-SG
 *      English; "studio apartment" or "two-bedroom" is the Western
 *      idiom for the same concept)
 *
 *  Once we have an anchor, we extract the most specific (flat type,
 *  room) pair we can and fall back to sensible defaults:
 *    - flat type defaults to 4-room (42% of HDB stock per the doc)
 *    - room defaults to master_bedroom (most-designed)
 *
 *  The matching is deliberately tolerant of natural phrasing:
 *  hyphens optional ("4-room" / "4 room" / "4room"), case-
 *  insensitive throughout, common synonyms accepted ("living room"
 *  → living_dining, "lounge" → living_dining).
 *
 *  Returns null when the prompt has no Singapore anchor OR has an
 *  anchor but is too generic to map to a specific (flat type, room)
 *  combination. The banner only shows when this returns non-null. */
