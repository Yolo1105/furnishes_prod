/**
 * friendlyError — translate technical error strings from API routes
 * into user-actionable chat messages.
 *
 * The orchestrator catches every failure (Claude refusal, Flux 503,
 * fal.ai rate limit, network drop) and emits an `error` SSE event
 * carrying the raw message. Showing the raw message in chat is
 * unhelpful — `429 rate_limit_exceeded {...}` is noise. This helper
 * matches against common patterns and returns a one-sentence message
 * the user can act on.
 *
 * Pattern-matching order matters: more specific patterns first, more
 * general patterns last. Every pattern is tested in order and the
 * first match wins. Anything unrecognized falls through to the raw
 * message — better to expose a real error than to mask it with a
 * generic "something went wrong."
