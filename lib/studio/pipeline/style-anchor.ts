/**
 * Style anchor pipeline — the ArtiScene 2D-first pattern.
 *
 * Why this exists:
 *
 *   Image-to-3D models generate each piece independently. Without
 *   coordination, pieces end up visually inconsistent — a mid-century
 *   sofa next to a Victorian lamp next to a Japanese table. The
 *   ArtiScene paper (CVPR 2025) introduces a fix:
 *
 *     1. Generate ONE reference image of an empty (or minimally-
 *        furnished) room in the target style using Flux.
 *     2. For each piece, build a Flux prompt that references the
 *        style bible AND explicitly cites the same materials / palette
 *        / mood as the reference.
 *     3. The downstream image-to-3D pass conditions on prompts that
 *        share linguistic anchors. Pieces inherit style coherence
 *        without any model coupling.
 *
 *   It works because Flux is sensitive to phrasing and these prompts
 *   share the same phrasing for materials / palette / lighting / mood.
 *
 * Each per-piece Flux call costs ~5s + ~$0.005, so a 6-piece room
 * generates ~$0.04 in image cost. The mesh providers downstream are
 * the dominant cost — caching the 2D images would only save the Flux
 * cost (small slice of the total). Cache layer is deferred.
 *
 * "Server-only" because every function calls fal.ai with the
 * server-side API key.

/** Compute a short proportion hint for the image prompt. The image
 *  generator (Flux) doesn't see the piece's dimensions — it sees only
 *  the description. Without dimensional context, it draws whatever it
 *  thinks fits, and the resulting mesh comes back with arbitrary
 *  proportions that don't match what Claude planned. A "low futon
 *  sofa" might come out tall and narrow if Flux's training data
 *  biased that way; a "tall bookshelf" might come out as a chest of
 *  drawers.
 *
 *  This function turns Claude's planned dimensions into a short
 *  natural-language proportion hint that primes Flux to draw the
 *  right shape:
 *
 *    2.0 × 0.6 × 0.9 (sofa: long × short-tall × medium-deep)
 *      → "long horizontal piece, 3× wider than tall"
 *    0.4 × 1.6 × 0.4 (floor lamp)
 *      → "tall vertical piece, 4× taller than wide"
 *    1.0 × 0.5 × 1.0 (square low table)
 *      → "wide and shallow, 2× wider than tall"
 *
 *  The hint goes into the image prompt right after the description so
 *  Flux uses it to pick framing + composition. This dramatically
 *  improves mesh quality — image-to-3D models can only reconstruct
 *  what's in the source image, so getting the shape right at the 2D
 *  step is the leverage point.
 *
 *  Heuristic chosen over precise aspect numbers: Flux interprets
 *  natural language proportions ("long horizontal", "tall narrow")
 *  much more reliably than numeric aspect ratios. The numeric ratio
 *  ("3× wider") is included as a backup for the cases where the
 *  natural language isn't specific enough.

 *    "neutral white background" — image-to-3D models hate cluttered backgrounds

 *    "front view, eye level" — fixes orientation. Without these, the

 *      down, beds on their side, pieces tilted at 45°). Front-view
 *      eye-level framing forces Flux to draw the piece upright with
 *      a consistent axis convention; image-to-3D models then output
 *      a mesh with Y-up and front-facing-Z that our scene can use
 *      without hand-rolling rotation correction.

 *  v0.40.21: Includes a proportion hint derived from the piece's
 *  planned dimensions so Flux generates an image with the right
 *  aspect ratio. Without this, mesh proportions came back arbitrary
 *  and downstream auto-scaling produced visibly squashed/melted
 *  pieces. The hint is the leverage point — fix the shape at the
 *  2D step, the 3D step inherits the fix automatically.
 *
 *  v0.40.22: Switched "3/4 view angle" → "front view, eye level,
 *  upright orientation" because the user reported pieces coming back
 *  in random orientations (a chair tilted 45°, a bed lying on its
 *  side). 3/4 view gives image-to-3D models more visual information
 *  but no consistent reconstruction axis, so the mesh's local Y can
 *  end up anywhere. Front-view-upright framing pins the orientation
 *  so the downstream mesh has predictable up/forward axes. */
