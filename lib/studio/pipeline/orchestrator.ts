/**
 * Generation orchestrator — async generator that emits StreamEvents.
 *
 * Pure-Node, no Python backend. Claude is the spatial reasoning engine
 * and the pipeline assembles per-piece meshes from its plan:
 *
 *   1. Call Claude with the user prompt → SceneGraph JSON
 *      (room dimensions, pieces, style bible)
 *   2. Validate with Zod → AssembledScene
 *   3. Emit: intent → style → layout events (so the client gets to
 *      see the room skeleton before any meshes are ready)
 *   4. In parallel, fire Flux for the room-level style anchor (cheap,
 *      ~5s, makes downstream piece prompts visually coherent)
 *   5. For each piece, with bounded concurrency: Flux 2D product shot
 *      → image-to-3D mesh provider → emit `piece_ready` event
 *   6. Wait on the style anchor → emit final `scene` event
 *
 * Failures cascade through `kind: "error"` events. Per-piece failures
 * emit a `progress` event with stage "piece_failed" so the rest of the
 * room still generates — a single dead piece doesn't kill the whole
 * room. The final scene contains the failed piece without a glb_url
 * which renders as a colored placeholder box (Turn 4).
 *
 * Server-only: Claude + fal.ai both require server-side API keys.

function buildSystemPrompt(): string {
  return `You are an interior design layout engine. Given a user prompt describing a room, produce a complete AssembledScene as JSON.

COORDINATE SYSTEM (CRITICAL):
- Room Director convention: z-axis is UP, x is east-west, y is north-south
- Room origin is the center of the floor; x ranges from -width_m/2 to +width_m/2, y from -depth_m/2 to +depth_m/2
- Piece positions are the CENTER of each piece's bounding box
- is_on_floor=true means piece sits with its bottom at z=0 (use z = height/2 for the center)
- Rotations are in degrees around the vertical (z) axis — prefer 0/90/180/270

SCENE CONSTRAINTS:
- Produce 6-9 pieces. Aim for a fully-furnished room, not a minimal sketch.
  Examples:
    Bedroom — bed, two nightstands, dresser, reading chair, rug, floor lamp.
    Living — sofa, coffee table, two side chairs, media unit, rug, floor lamp.
    Dining — dining table, 4-6 chairs, sideboard or buffet, rug, pendant or
      floor lamp.
- All pieces must fit inside the room bounds with at least 10cm clearance from walls
- Pieces must not overlap each other
- Include realistic dimensions in meters (e.g., sofa 2.0m × 0.9m × 0.8m)
- Each piece needs a unique id (e.g., "sofa_01", "rug_01")

ROTATION RULES (avoid the "random orientation" trap):
- Beds: long axis perpendicular to the wall the headboard touches; rotation chosen
  so the headboard FACES THE WALL (i.e., the foot of the bed faces room interior).
  A bed against the +z wall (north) is rotated 0°; against +x wall is 90°; etc.
- Nightstands: must flank the bed with the SAME rotation as the bed.
- Sofas: back against a wall whenever possible; rotation chosen so the seat faces
  into the room. A sofa with its back on the -z wall (south) has rotation 180°.
- Armchairs / lounge chairs: face the room's primary seating focus (usually the
  coffee table or the sofa); avoid pointing at a wall.
- Desks: back against a wall, work surface facing the room. The user sits between
  the desk and the room.
- Dining tables: rotation 0° (long axis = x). Chairs around it face the table.
- Bookshelves / wardrobes / dressers: back flush against a wall, opening facing
  the room.
- Rugs: rotation 0 unless they're explicitly oriented (e.g., a runner aligned with
  a hallway).
- Coffee tables: rotation 0 — usually neutral, oriented to align with the sofa.
- Lamps + decorative objects: rotation 0 unless directional (e.g., spotlights).
- General: rotations should be 0, 90, 180, or 270. Only emit other values if the
  user explicitly asked for a diagonal placement.

STYLE BIBLE:
- Include a palette (walls hex color, accent hex color, optional floor_tint)
- Include materials (dominant_wood, primary_textile, optional metal)
- Include lighting: "warm-soft" | "cool-bright" | "dramatic" | "neutral"
- Include a mood string and a forbidden array of anti-styles

ROOM SHELL:
- If the user specifies dimensions in the prompt (e.g., "12x15 ft bedroom",
  "4.5m by 5m living room", "small 3x4 study"), HONOR THEM. Convert feet
  to meters (1 ft = 0.3048 m). If no dimensions are given, pick reasonable
  sizes for the room type.
- Default height_m is 2.7m unless the prompt suggests otherwise.
- Shape defaults to "rectangle". If the user says "L-shaped", "U-shaped",
  "open plan", or describes an irregular footprint, you MUST also emit a
  custom \`walls\` array (see below). Otherwise leave \`walls: []\` and the
  client synthesizes a 4-wall rectangle from width × depth.
- For L/U-shape rooms: each wall segment is { id, x1, z1, x2, z2, thickness }.
  Coordinates are meters in y-UP world space, room centered on origin
  (so a 4m wide room has walls at x = ±2). Thickness is typically 0.15.
  An L-shape, for example, has 6 wall segments instead of 4.
- Include openings (door, window) on specific walls if the prompt suggests them.

SATISFIED_RELATIONS (declare what each piece's placement achieves):
Each piece's "satisfied_relations" array should list the spatial relationships the placement satisfies, using a small vocabulary. The validator checks these geometrically — false claims dock the layout score, so claim only what's true.
- "near:<piece_id>"      → centers within 1.0m of <piece_id>
- "faces:<piece_id>"     → this piece's facing direction (local +y, rotated by z_angle) points at <piece_id> within ±30°
- "flanking:<piece_id>"  → sits alongside <piece_id> with overlapping depth-range, gap ≤ 0.3m
- "against:wall"         → nearest face within 0.15m of any room wall
- "centered:wall"        → centered along its closest wall (within 0.5m of wall midpoint)
Example: a coffee table 0.6m in front of a sofa would claim ["near:sofa_01"]; a sofa with its back on a wall would claim ["against:wall"]; nightstands beside a bed would each claim ["flanking:bed_01", "near:bed_01"]; a chair facing a desk would claim ["faces:desk_01", "near:desk_01"]. Aim for 1-3 relations per piece — the relationships that actually define the arrangement.

Return ONLY valid JSON matching this shape — no markdown, no prose, no fences.
