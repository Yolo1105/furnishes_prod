/**
 * Runtime classifiers for furniture, ported 1:1 from the zip's
 * `lib/ingest/displayNames.ts` + `lib/ingest/extractItemPrefix.ts`.
 *
 * The zip computes shape, color, and label at *runtime* from the
 * catalog id rather than trusting the static fields on the catalog
 * JSON. Two reasons:
 *
 *   1. **Shape** is bound to 2D-plan rendering semantics. The zip's
 *      FloorPlan2D branches on three values — "circle" / "thin-rect"
 *      / everything-else — and `classifyShape` is the function that
 *      decides which a given item gets. Trusting the catalog's
 *      shape field (which has values like "lamp", "vase", "box",
 *      "decor") would mean every item falls through to the default
 *      rectangle, losing the visual variety the zip's plan has.
 *
 *   2. **Label** has curated overrides. The auto-generated label
 *      "Bathroom Flush" reads worse than "Toilet"; the override
 *      table fixes that for ~20 items.
 *
 *   3. **Color** is per-item, deterministic from id hash, so each
 *      catalog item gets a stable distinct color across reloads
 *      without any authored color data.
 */
