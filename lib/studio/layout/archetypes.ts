/**
 * Layout archetypes — Increment 2 of the layout-quality work.
 *
 * Ports `configs/layout_archetypes.yaml` from the Furniture-
 * Arrangement-Generator repo as TypeScript data, plus a room-type
 * detector and a prompt formatter. Used by the orchestrator to
 * inject canonical placement patterns into the system prompt
 * before Claude generates the layout — gives Claude concrete
 * priors instead of cold-starting from "place 5-8 pieces."
 *
 * The archetypes themselves are well-known interior design
 * conventions (centered_bed, focal_point, conversation_area, etc.).
 * Each is a small list of (piece_type, position_constraint, target,
 * distance_range, priority) rules. Claude reads these as guidance,
 * not hard requirements — it picks an archetype that matches the
 * user's intent and uses the rules to place the relevant pieces.
 *
 * Detection: we run a small set of keyword rules against the
 * user's prompt to pick a room type. Conservative — when in doubt,
 * we return null and the orchestrator skips the archetype
 * injection (Claude falls back to the existing prompt). False
 * positives are worse than false negatives here: telling Claude
 * "this is a bedroom, prefer the centered_bed archetype" when the
 * user asked for a living room would produce a worse layout than
 * the no-archetype baseline.
