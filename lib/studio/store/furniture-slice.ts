 * One catalog item registered with the scene. The mental model is
 * that there is a single, fixed *universe* of items (the 65 entries
 * in the catalog whose meshes are present in apartamento.glb) and
 * each item is either currently `placed` in the scene or not.
 *
 *   • Inventory tool   — shows items with `placed: true`
 *   • Catalog modal    — shows items with `placed: false`
 *
 * The two are complementary views over the same array. Adding from
 * Catalog flips `placed` true; deleting from Inventory flips it
 * false. There is no separate "list of placed things" — there is
 * one list, and a flag.
 *
 * `meshes` holds direct references to the THREE.Object3D nodes
 * inside the apartamento scene graph that correspond to this item.
 * The Apartment component subscribes to slice changes and applies
 * `mesh.visible = item.placed && item.visible` to each ref on
 * every frame the relevant flags change. Because these refs are
 * non-serializable, the slice is in-memory only — fine, since
 * apartament state is rebuilt from the GLB on every page load.
