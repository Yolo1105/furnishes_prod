 * Requirements slice. User-stated design preferences that shape the
 * Planner's arrangement generation. Pure form-state today (Phase F1)
 * — Phase E1 will read this slice when calling /api/arrange to drive
 *  what Claude knows about the user's must-haves, constraints, and
 *  priorities.
 *
 * Adapted from the zip's lib/store/requirements-slice.ts. Behavior is
 * identical: editing any field sets `presetName: null` so the active
 * preset selector clears (the user has "tweaked" off the preset).
 * Preset application is the only path that sets a preset name.
 *
 * Currently isolated from arrangement application — no consumer reads
 * these values yet because Phase E1 hasn't shipped. The slice exists
 * so the Requirements tab UI can persist edits across panel close/
 * reopen and across sessions (when persistence lands in Phase G).
