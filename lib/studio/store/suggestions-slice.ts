/**
 * Suggestions slice — in-memory state for the proactive design
 * suggestions feature.
 *
 * # What lives here
 *
 * - **suggestions**: the current list of parsed `Suggestion` cards.
 *   Empty when nothing has been generated this session.
 *
 * - **streamingText**: the raw, cumulative text being streamed from
 *   the brain right now. Used for two things: (1) parsing into
 *   `suggestions` as new `### Suggestion N` boundaries appear, and
 *   (2) rendering the in-progress card with its body still arriving.
 *
 * - **isGenerating**: true while a generation request is in flight.
 *   The Generate button shows a spinner; new requests are ignored.
 *
 * - **error**: a user-facing error string. Set by the API call when
 *   the brain is disabled, the cap is hit, or something else goes
 *   wrong. Cleared when a new request starts.
 *
 * - **remainingToday**: the daily-cap counter from the server, if
 *   known. Null when we haven't asked yet (initial state) or when
 *   the brain is disabled (no cap). The UI shows "X / cap today".
 *
 * - **capPerDay**: the cap value the server is using. Same null
 *   semantics as remainingToday.
 *
 * - **lastGeneratedAt**: timestamp (ms) of the most recent successful
 *   generation. Used to show "Last generated 3 minutes ago" in the UI.
 *
 * - **brainEnabled**: whether the server has the brain pipeline on.
 *   Determined by the GET /api/suggestions response. Null until first
 *   probed.
 *
 * # What does NOT live here
 *
 * - Server-side state. The daily-cap counter on the server is
 *   independent; we read it from response headers / GET endpoint.
 * - Persistence. Refreshing the page wipes everything. Re-generating
 *   is one click. Persistence would require a schema bump.
 * - Modal open/close state. That lives in ui-flags-slice next to the
 *   other modal toggles.
