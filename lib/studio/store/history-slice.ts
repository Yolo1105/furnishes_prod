/**
 * History slice — undo/redo stacks for scene-state mutations.
 *
 * Right now there is no scene state to undo (the GLB is static and no
 * furniture edits are wired). Both stacks stay empty and the actions
 * are no-ops, but the slice exists so the top bar's Undo / Redo
 * buttons can read `undoDepth` / `redoDepth` and disable themselves
 * truthfully — if the depth is 0, the button is disabled.
 *
 * When furniture editing lands in a future step, every mutating
 * action will call `pushSnapshot(...)` before applying the change,
 * and `undo` / `redo` will pop / push between the two stacks. The
 * snapshot shape is intentionally typed as `unknown` here so the
 * future furniture slice can pick its own snapshot format without
 * forcing a refactor of this file.
