/**
 * Preferences slice — the brain's memory of what the user has told it
 * about their taste, constraints, and goals.
 *
 * Schema 3.3.0 introduces this as a per-project array of structured
 * Preference records (NOT a flat string→string Map like eva uses).
 * Every record carries source attribution so we can audit + correct
 * extracted preferences without manual review of full conversation
 * transcripts.
 *
 * # Why structured records (Risk 4 mitigation)
 *
 * Eva extracts preferences as `Record<string, string>` — opaque, no
 * provenance. If a turn says "I want walnut" and the extractor stores
 * `{ "wood": "walnut" }`, we have no record of *which turn* said
 * that, *what the user actually wrote*, or *how confident* the
 * extractor was. The next turn the assistant says "since you
 * mentioned walnut" — but the user said "walnut maybe?" and now they
 * feel mis-quoted.
 *
 * Our records carry:
 *   - `value`: the canonical key/value pair the brain reads
 *   - `sourceText`: the exact substring of the user turn that
 *     produced this preference. Empty extraction → preference doesn't
 *     get stored. (Turn 2c enforces this.)
 *   - `sourceTurnId`: which turn produced it (per ConversationTurn.id)
 *   - `confidence`: the extractor's 0..1 self-rating
 *   - `status`: "provisional" (under threshold), "confirmed" (above
 *     threshold), or "rejected" (user contradicted, kept for audit)
 *   - `extractedAt` / `updatedAt` timestamps for ordering
 *
 * # Threshold-based persistence
 *
 * Turn 2c's extractor returns `confidence`. The persistence policy
 * (also in Turn 2c) is:
 *   - confidence < 0.7  → drop entirely
 *   - 0.7 <= conf < 0.9 → status = "provisional", persist
 *   - conf >= 0.9       → status = "confirmed", persist
 *
 * Provisional preferences appear in the prompt block but are
 * presented as "{key}: {value} (the user mentioned this; double-check
 * before relying)". Confirmed preferences appear without that hedge.
 *
 * # Two-strikes deletion (Risk 4)
 *
 * When a turn explicitly contradicts a stored preference ("not
 * walnut, oak"), the contradiction detector (Turn 2c) flips the
 * matching preference's `status` to "rejected" rather than deleting.
 * Audit trail preserved. The brain's prompt block excludes rejected
 * preferences. If the user reaffirms the original ("actually walnut
 * is fine"), the extractor adds a fresh provisional record — old
 * rejected one stays for history.
 *
 * # Cross-project scoping
 *
 * Each preference belongs to exactly one project (`projectId`).
 * Switching projects swaps which preferences are visible. The slice
 * stores ALL preferences across ALL projects in one flat array; the
 * `selectCurrentProjectPreferences` selector filters to the active
 * project. Same pattern as `conversations` from 0.34.0.
