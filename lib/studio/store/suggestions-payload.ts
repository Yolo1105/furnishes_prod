/**
 * Suggestions request payload builder.
 *
 * Uses the same snapshot projection as `buildBrainPayload` in
 * chat-slice (`buildStudioSnapshotForBrain`) so caps and field layout
 * cannot drift. Produces the body shape `/api/studio/suggestions`
 * expects on POST — same snapshot + preferences + recent-turns
 * fields, no message field (the trigger is server-side), no top-level
 * mode (suggestions route does not apply mode policy).
 *
 * Lives in its own file so the suggestions slice can import it
 * without creating a circular dependency with chat-slice (which
 * happens when both slices import each other's helpers transitively
 * through the assembled store).
