/**
 * Derived selectors. These are computed views on top of the store
 * that are useful in multiple places and benefit from memoization.
 *
 * Pattern: subscribe to the underlying primitive state, then
 * compute the derived shape via useMemo. Components can then
 * import the derived hook instead of recomputing in N places.
 *
 * Why a separate module: keeping derived selectors out of the
 * slice files means slices stay narrow (state + actions only),
 * and composing across slices (e.g., placed furniture × wall
 * proximity) doesn't pollute any single slice. The zip uses
 * the same pattern in its `lib/store/use-store-derived.ts`.
 *
 * As more phases ship, this file accrues selectors. Today it
 * exposes lightweight wrappers around existing per-slice
 * selectors plus a placed-with-positions composite that's
 * useful for the upcoming Phase C door-clearance overlay and
 * Phase E AI-generation pipeline.
