/**
 * Profile slice — the user's optional generation context.
 *
 * v0.40.37 introduced this for Singapore HDB support. A "profile"
 * pins the architectural context Claude generates against — when the
 * user has selected "Singapore HDB 4-room master bedroom," every
 * subsequent room/interior generation uses those EXACT dimensions
 * and conventions instead of inventing them.
 *
 * v0.40.39 storage rework: profile is now PROJECT-SCOPED, not
 * globally sticky. Each project carries its own profile in its IDB
 * snapshot. The persistence layer (usePersistence.ts → applySnapshot)
 * hydrates `currentProfile` from the active project; the autosave
 * subscription persists changes back. This module no longer touches
 * localStorage directly.
 *
 * Why per-project (not global): a user designing their HDB flat in
 * one project shouldn't have that profile silently apply to a
 * separate "Western suburban house" project they open later. The
 * profile is project-level context, not a user preference.
 *
 * One-time migration: v0.40.38 stored the active profile in a global
 * localStorage key (`furnishes:active-profile@v1`). On first slice
 * creation we check that key — if a profile is there, we use it as
 * the initial value AND delete the key so we never read it again.
 * The autosave will pick up the seeded value on its next tick and
 * write it into the active project's snapshot, completing the
 * migration. After that, the key is gone and behavior is fully
 * project-scoped.
 *
 * Read pattern:
 *   const profile = useStore(s => s.currentProfile)
 *   if (profile?.kind === "sg-hdb") { ... use profile.flatType, profile.room ... }
 *
 * Write pattern:
 *   useStore.getState().setProfile({ kind: "sg-hdb", flatType: "4-room", room: "master_bedroom" })
 *   useStore.getState().setProfile(null)  // clear
