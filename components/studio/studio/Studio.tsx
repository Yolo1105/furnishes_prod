/**
 * Top-level shell. Composes the layers of the app:
 *
 *   z=1   MainViewport — full-viewport 3D scene OR 2D floor plan
 *                        depending on `mainViewMode`. Swapped by
 *                        the Reference card's swap button.
 *   z=4   Tool floating cards (Reference, Pieces, Health). Each is
 *         independently draggable.
 *   z=5   Brand UI: TopProjectCard, ToolsCard, TopBar, ChatDock
 *         — hidden when immersive mode is active. All draggable
 *           except the chat dock and top bar (anchored controls).
 *   z=30  Top-bar dropdowns (env lighting picker)
 *   z=40+ ComingSoonCard backdrop + card
 *   z=50  ImmersiveToast — appears briefly on entry to immersive
 *   z=100 UploadModal, HelpModal — centered overlays
 *
 * Immersive mode (`H` to toggle, `Esc` to exit) hides every
 * floating UI surface so the user can see the main viewport
 * unobstructed. The floating UI is unmounted (not just visually
 * hidden) so its local dropdowns and hover states reset cleanly
 * between sessions.

      {/* Floating UI surfaces — hidden during immersive mode. Each is
          wrapped in StaggeredMount so the surfaces fade in over ~1
          second on first paint (TopBar first, then the corner cards,
          then chat). Reads like a real product loading itself in
          rather than every card appearing simultaneously. The wrapper
          is opacity-only — fixed-positioned children's anchors are
          preserved. prefers-reduced-motion users skip the animation.

          v0.40.42: instead of mounting/unmounting on `immersive`
          (hard cut), keep the tree mounted and animate
          opacity + transform when immersive toggles. The user
          reported that pressing H to hide caused everything to
          vanish abruptly, then reappear with a jarring layout
          jolt because each StaggeredMount re-ran its animation
          schedule. Now the tree stays mounted: hidden via opacity:0
          with pointerEvents:none + a subtle 4px upward translate to
          give the fade a sense of "lifting away" rather than just
          dimming.

          v0.40.45 CRITICAL FIX: dropped the transform.
          ANY transform on an ancestor (including transform:
          translateY(0) — the identity case) creates a new containing
          block for position:fixed descendants per CSS spec. That
          broke EVERY fixed-positioned UI surface inside this wrapper:
          TopBar, TopProjectCard, ToolsCard, the floating tool cards,
          PropertiesCard, ChatDock — they all became positioned
          relative to this 0-height wrapper instead of the viewport.
          Result: the user couldn't see the chat input box and
          couldn't click anything because nothing was where it should
          be on screen. Opacity alone gives us the fade without
          breaking layout. */}
