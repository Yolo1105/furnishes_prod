/**
 * StaggeredMount — wrapper that fades its children in after a
 * configurable delay. Used at the studio root to give the first-load
 * experience a "real website" feel: instead of every card appearing
 * simultaneously the moment React mounts, the surfaces settle in
 * over ~1 second in a deliberate sequence.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   - On mount, children render at opacity 0.
 *   - After `delayMs`, the children fade to opacity 1 over `durationMs`
 *     (default 360ms) using a soft ease-out curve.
 *   - During the fade window, `pointer-events: none` prevents
 *     accidental clicks on a half-faded card.
 *   - `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` users see all children
 *     immediately at full opacity (skipped animation).
 *
 * Why opacity-only (no transform):
 *   Children of this wrapper use `position: fixed`. A non-zero
 *   `transform` on the wrapper would establish a containing block
 *   for those descendants, making them position relative to the
 *   wrapper instead of the viewport — which changes their layout
 *   while the animation runs. Sticking to opacity keeps the layout
 *   stable; the fade alone is enough for the staggered-entry feel.
