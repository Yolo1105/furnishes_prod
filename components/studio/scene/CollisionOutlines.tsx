/**
 * Collision outlines. Renders a red wireframe box around any
 * placed item that currently overlaps another item, so the user
 * has persistent at-a-glance "this is wrong" feedback even without
 * opening the Health tab.
 *
 * Sister component to F4 Health's overlap rule — same predicate
 * (findOverlappingIds), different surface. Health gives the user
 * a clickable text row; this gives them a 3D indicator. Both are
 * useful — Health for "what specifically is wrong" detail, this
 * for "something is wrong, look at the red box."
 *
 * Implementation notes:
 *   - The outline box is sized 3% larger than the item's AABB so
 *     it sits visibly outside the mesh rather than z-fighting with
 *     it. depthTest false + renderOrder 998 = always visible.
 *   - Rotation is applied per-item — the outline rotates with the
 *     item so it stays aligned with the actual furniture footprint.
 *   - Y position is hardcoded to height/2 (item sits on the floor;
 *     wrapping-group setup means item.y doesn't exist as a state
 *     field; vertical placement comes from the GLB authoring).
 *   - useMemo on the overlap set + the item lookup so we don't
 *     recompute pairwise AABB on every render. Recomputes only
 *     when the furniture array reference changes (which the
 *     gizmo + apply path both update through setItemTransform).
 *   - No subscriber/slice surface — pure derivation from existing
 *     state. Adding a slice field would be redundant when F4
 *     Health already does the same computation inline.
