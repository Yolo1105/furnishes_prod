/**
 * Renders an orange wireframe box around the currently-selected
 * inventory item's actual GLB meshes. The box is computed in world
 * space from `Box3.expandByObject` over each mesh ref the
 * furniture-slice tracks for that item, so it follows the real
 * geometry — not metadata.
 *
 * Behavior:
 *   • Renders only when `selectedId` is set AND the item is `placed`
 *     AND `visible` (no point outlining a hidden mesh).
 *   • Uses `EdgesGeometry` over a `BoxGeometry` sized to the
 *     mesh-aggregate bounding box, so we draw the 12 edges of the
 *     box (no diagonals).
 *   • `depthTest: false` + high `renderOrder` keeps the box visible
 *     even when the camera is on the wrong side of a wall — the
 *     selection cue should always be findable.
 *   • Colored with the brand accent, slight transparency for
 *     subtlety against bright backdrops.
 *
 * Mounted as a child of `<Scene>` so it lives inside the R3F
 * Canvas. When the main view is in 2D mode, `<Scene>` itself isn't
 * mounted, so this component naturally doesn't render in that
 * mode.
 *
 * Recomputed on every change to `selectedId` or to `furniture`
 * (which changes when items are placed / removed / hidden /
 * shown). The `Box3` is computed once per change inside `useMemo`,
 * so frame-time cost is zero — we don't recompute every frame.
 *
 * Future: when items become draggable / repositionable, we'll
 * need a `useFrame` to update the box per-frame. For now the
 * meshes are static at their GLB positions, so a one-shot box
 * suffices.
