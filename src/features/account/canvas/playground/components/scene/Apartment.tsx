/**
 * Loads a GLB at the given URL, clones the scene graph (so we don't
 * mutate drei's cached original), normalizes it into viewer space,
 * and returns it as a `<primitive>` for R3F to render.
 *
 * Two side effects on top of rendering:
 *
 * 1. **Seeds the furniture-slice from the GLB.** Once the catalog
 *    JSON has loaded, walks each catalog entry's `nodeNames`, looks
 *    them up in this scene's mesh graph, and registers a PlacedItem
 *    per match. Result: the moment Apartment mounts, the Inventory
 *    tool can show every piece already in the apartment (~65 items)
 *    instead of an empty list.
 *
 * 2. **Subscribes to slice changes and drives mesh visibility.**
 *    For every PlacedItem, sets `mesh.visible = item.placed &&
 *    item.visible` on every ref. So the eye-toggle and trash
 *    actions in Inventory actually hide/show meshes in the
 *    apartment view; the Catalog's "Add" actions actually unhide
 *    them.
 *
 * Suspends while the GLB is downloading + parsed — wrap callers
 * in a `<Suspense>` boundary.
