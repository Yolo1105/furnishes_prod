/**
 * Line-based SSE (Server-Sent Events) parser.
 *
 * The fetch streaming API gives us raw text chunks. SSE events are
 * separated by blank lines and look like:
 *
 *     data: { "kind": "intent", "intent": {...} }
 *
 *     data: { "kind": "style", "style": {...} }
 *
 * Two challenges solved here:
 *
 *   1. Chunk boundaries don't align to event boundaries. A chunk can
 *      arrive with a half-finished event at the end (`data: {"kind":
 *      "intent", "inten`) followed by the rest in the next chunk. We
 *      keep a buffer that holds the trailing incomplete line until
 *      the next chunk completes it.
 *
 *   2. Some events have malformed JSON (rare — provider hiccup, mid-
 *      generation error). We skip those instead of throwing, so a
 *      single bad event doesn't kill the whole stream. The orchestrator
 *      can also emit explicit `error` events when something goes
 *      wrong; those have well-formed JSON and are surfaced normally.
 *
 * The terminator `[DONE]` is fal.ai/OpenAI convention: it signals the
 * stream is finished. We don't emit it as a parsed event — the
 * caller knows the stream is over because the fetch readable closes.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     const parser = createSSEParser<StreamEvent>();
 *     for await (const chunk of streamReader()) {
 *       for (const event of parser.feed(chunk)) {
 *         handleEvent(event);
 *       }
 *     }
 *     // optional: parser.flush() returns any remaining buffered event
 */

  /** Feed a new chunk of text from the stream. Returns any events
   *  that completed inside this chunk (zero, one, or many). */

   *  closes; usually returns an empty array unless the server didn't
   *  emit a final blank line. */
