// Design-rule engine. Each rule reads the current placed scene plus
// the user's requirements, and returns zero or more violations. The
// Health tab renders the aggregated violation list.
//
// Rules are pure functions over the scene state — they read the
// store but don't write to it. The tab calls runHealthChecks(...)
// once per render and gets back a typed violation list.
//
// Adding a rule: write a new RuleFn, push it to the RULES array.
// No other plumbing needed; the tab will pick it up automatically.
