/**
 * place-generated-asset — drop a finished asset into the live scene
 * as a new PlacedItem.
 *
 * Was previously inlined inside RecentGenerationsBar; promoted to a
 * shared helper in v0.40.4 so chat-slice can also call it after a
 * generation lands (auto-placement). Without this auto-placement the
 * user had to click the tile in the Recent Generations bar manually,
 * which made the result feel disconnected from the generation flow.
 *
 * Position rules:
 *   - viewer-source: drop at the apartment's bounding-box midpoint
 *   - room-director: drop at world origin (the generated room is
 *     centered there by convention)
 *
 * The piece is auto-placed with `placed: true` + `visible: true` so
 * it appears immediately in the inventory panel and the 3D scene.
 *
 * NOTE: this helper does NOT call `selectFurniture` — auto-selection
 * was the source of the orange wireframe + selection circle that
 * appeared the moment a piece dropped, which the user found visually
 * noisy. They can click the piece if they want to manipulate it.
