/**
 * Generations slice. Owns the most-recent set of arrangement
 * candidates returned by /api/arrange, plus the index of the
 * currently-selected (or applied) candidate.
 *
 * Lifted out of OptionsTab's local state in Phase F2 so multiple
 * planner tabs can read the same candidate list:
 *   - OptionsTab     — generates + applies (writes via setCandidates,
 *                      setAppliedIndex)
 *   - InspectTab     — diffs the candidate against current scene
 *                      (reads currentCandidate via inspectIndex)
 *   - PlacedTab (F3) — review of the applied candidate
 *   - ExplainTab (F5) — AI-narrated reasoning per candidate
 *
 * Two indexes:
 *   - `appliedIndex` — set by OptionsTab when the user clicks Apply.
 *     Drives the "Applied" treatment on that card AND tells later
 *     tabs which candidate is currently committed to the scene.
 *   - `inspectIndex` — set by InspectTab's dropdown. Independent of
 *     applied — you can inspect candidate B while candidate A is
 *     applied, comparing what B would do without committing yet.
 *
 * Candidates are NOT persisted (they're transient generation results,
 * not user-edited state). Cleared on `resetGenerations`.
