/**
 * Camera presets used by the top bar's "Shuffle" action and as the

 * in normalized scene units (the apartment has been normalized to
 * ~10m on its longest axis with the floor at y=0 and the X/Z
 * footprint centered at origin — see `lib/three/normalize.ts`).
 *
 * The first entry (index 0) is the default boot view and the target
 * for the Reset Camera action. The remaining entries are cinematic
 * variants the Shuffle button cycles through.
 *
 * Coordinates were tuned for the apartamento.glb in this repo; if
 * the GLB is swapped out, these may need to be re-tuned to keep the
 * apartment in frame.
