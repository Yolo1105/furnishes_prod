Add a low-pile cream rug that extends past the bed on three sides, and place a matte brass pendant slightly off-center above one nightstand for soft asymmetry. Close the palette with a single sage-green plant in a fluted ceramic pot.",

Open shelving in rift-sawn oak on one wall, limewash paint above the backsplash, and a cast-iron sink to anchor the working zone. Pendants should be ceramic — organic forms, not too sleek.",

A sculptural travertine coffee table grounds the center. Two matching reading chairs in caramel leather opposite the sofa. Finish with a single oversized ceramic vase and a linen floor lamp with a warm bulb.",

Use wall-hung furniture to free the floor visually, a single oversized mirror leaning on one wall, and sheer linen curtains hung floor-to-ceiling (ignore the actual window height). Pick one statement piece; let everything else recede.",

      "I'm thinking a warm earth palette: bone white base (walls + trim), warm taupe mid-tones (upholstery + curtains), burnt sienna accent (pillows + art), and a grounding deep walnut (wood pieces + frames). Add 5% of a soft sage green through plants to prevent it from feeling too dry. Avoid pure whites and cool grays — they'll clash with the warmth.",

Mix old and new: one antique piece per room, the rest contemporary but understated. A faint smell of cedar and linen would complete it, if interiors had scent.",

Use 2700K bulbs everywhere. Avoid anything cooler than 3000K — it'll kill the warmth of your finishes. Put everything on dimmers.",

Size it generously — the front legs of your seating should sit ON the rug, not float beside it. Under a dining area, the rug should extend 24 inches past the table on all sides so chairs stay on it when pulled out.",
