/**
 * Suggestions system prompt builder.
 *
 * Reuses the chat-brain prompt layers (domain config, studio context,
 * design rules, project memory) but replaces the conversational voice
 * tier with a proactive-observer voice. Output format is asked for as
 * `### Suggestion N: Title\nBody` so the client can split on
 * boundaries and render cards as text streams in.
 *
 * # What's different from chat
 *
 * - **No user message.** The brain is generating proactively, not
 *   responding to a question. The synthetic user message we feed the
 *   pump is just "Generate suggestions for this scene."
 *
 * - **Proactive-observer voice.** Tells the model it's an interior
 *   designer reviewing the user's space and surfacing observations,
 *   rather than responding to a request. Different cadence — short
 *   declarative cards, not conversational prose.
 *
 * - **Card output format.** Asks for 3-5 numbered suggestions with a
 *   short title and a 1-3 sentence body. The client parses on the
 *   `### Suggestion N:` boundaries.
 *
 * - **Mode policy is inert.** Mode policy (Turn 4) doesn't apply here
 *   — suggestions are always proactive. We omit it from the layer
 *   stack.
 *
 * # What's the same as chat
 *
 * - Studio context layer (Turn 2) — same scene serialization
 * - Design rules layer (Turn 4) — same rule library, same selector
 * - Project memory layer (Turn 2) — same preference rendering
 * - Domain config base voice (Turn 2) — same designer persona
 * - Scope footer (Turn 1) — keeps the model on topic
 *
 * # Empty-scene handling
 *
 * When the snapshot is null or the room has zero placed pieces, we
 * append a small note to the prompt asking the model to suggest
 * starting points (largest piece first, anchor furniture, etc.)
 * rather than nag about a missing scene. The model still produces
 * 3-5 suggestions; they just look different.
