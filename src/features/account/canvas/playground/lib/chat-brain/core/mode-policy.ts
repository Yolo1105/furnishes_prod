/**
 * Mode policy.
 *
 * Each chat turn arrives with a `mode` selected by the user from
 * the chat dock dropdown:
 *
 *   - **Ask** — read-only Q&A. The brain describes, explains, and
 *     teaches. It does NOT propose changes to the scene. If the user
 *     asks "should I move my sofa", the brain answers with reasoning
 *     and tradeoffs but does not say "I'd move it 30cm toward the
 *     window" — instead it might say "the trade-off is X vs Y".
 *
 *   - **Interior Design** — full design conversation. The brain
 *     suggests changes, proposes layouts, contrasts options. This is
 *     the default mode and the richest voice tier.
 *
 *   - **Furniture** — single-piece generation context. The user is
 *     producing one new furniture item; the brain helps shape the
 *     piece's specification (dimensions, materials, style) before
 *     generation runs.
 *
 *   - **Room Layout** — room-director generation context. The user
 *     is producing a full room. The brain helps with room intent
 *     (style bible, room type, layout direction) before generation.
 *
 * # Why mode-as-policy and not mode-as-flag
 *
 * Eva (and our Turn 2 domain config) already mention mode discipline
 * as a *directive* in the static system prompt. The model reads it
 * but treats it as guidance — and a sufficiently insistent user can
 * talk it into ignoring the rule. That's fine for soft enforcement
 * (which is all we have today; we don't have a structured-action
 * gate), but the directive is more effective when it's *current* —
 * delivered as the LAST instruction the model reads before
 * generation, after all the studio context and preferences.
 *
 * That's what this module does: produces a per-mode prompt amendment
 * the prompt-stack assembly slots in just before the scope-restriction
 * footer (Layer 9.5). It re-asserts the mode's contract right before
 * the model speaks, where it has the most weight.
 *
 * # Why not enforce at the output layer
 *
 * The "right" enforcement is structural: in Ask mode, the model
 * shouldn't be ABLE to emit action proposals (because there's no
 * action-emission slot). We don't have action proposals yet (Turn
 * 4 explicitly defers them — see TURN_PROGRESS.md), so we
 * have nothing to gate. When action proposals land, that's the
 * place to turn this soft policy into a hard one.
